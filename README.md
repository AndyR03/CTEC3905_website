The purpose of this website is to help people get started with Docker. Docker has in the last few years become almost an industrial standard. Every Google server now has Docker Containers on it. With it's quick setup and tear-down time (milliseconds) as opposed to full virtual machines with a boot up time of at least a minute they are the future of the internet. Whole back-end stacks can built on one physical server, although it is advised not to mix containers with normal services as this can cause not only a clash of resources but a security issue.
I wanted a simple lay out which is quick and easy to navigate. The purpose is to disseminate the information quickly and easily. Not to entertain, or amuse and certainly no unnecessary distractions. Therefore the user should be able to go quickly to the section they want.  To that end I have installed clearly labelled docker icons with links to the relevant sections.  Keeping things minimal and with left alignment means it has a technical document feel to it.  It is easy to follow and not lose your place when working through the instructions.  The only concession to style is to use the official Dockers colours and the Docker Swarm GIF.
After working through the site they should be able to install Docker and run their first container and even do some basic setup and maintenance. The site should have interactive diagrams to explain how do Docker works and another interactive section quizzes them on the most useful commands.  This has been done using Grid.  This enables us to place the boxes exactly where they are wanted and not generated in a loose pattern or become disorganised during resizing.  It is therefore possible to show a diagram which gives the graphical layout within a Docker.  This format is very good for technical diagrams where relative placement is important.  The site has also been designed with easy maintenance, additions and updates in mind because the subject is relatively new and so details change on an almost daily basis.
The site is rounded off with a small section of useful links to further reading on other websites.
A Google map is provided by a JavaScript.  It is called from it’s own folder the same as the CSS style-sheet.
In the footer will be links to generic things and the top of the page as well the CSS validation certificate.

A design meeting was held to discuss progress and testing.
